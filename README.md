# Feedback App

This is a fullstack app built using React, Redux, Node, Express, Google OAuth (with cookie-based authentication), PassportJS, MongooseJS, and MongoDB (using mLab for remote database hosting) for collecting feedback, and payment handling via Stripe, with guidance from Stephen Grider's Udemy course.

Next feature to be added: MongoDB.

A 'config' folder needs to be created in the 'server' directory, with a 'keys.js' file containing keys for certain sections of the project.

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd FeedbackApp
2) npm install
3)
