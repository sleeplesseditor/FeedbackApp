# Feedback App

This is a fullstack (MERN) app built using React, Redux, Node, Express, Google OAuth (with cookie-based authentication), PassportJS, MongooseJS, and MongoDB (using mLab for remote database hosting) for collecting feedback, and payment handling via Stripe, with guidance from Stephen Grider's Udemy course.

The React front-end components were built using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Next feature to be added: React client architecture

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd FeedbackApp
2) npm install
3) npm run dev
