This is a fullstack app built using React, Redux, Node, Express, Google OAuth (with cookie-based authentication), PassportJS, MongooseJS, and MongoDB (using mLab for remote database hosting) for collecting feedback, and payment handling via Stripe, with guidance from Stephen Grider's Udemy course.

Next feature to be added: React client architecture

2) npm install
3) npm run dev
